## 📌 About

**SyncWear** is a first-of-its-kind solution that makes **Wear OS usable with iOS**.  
By combining **Bluetooth ANCS**, **HFP**, and a **local HTTP server**, SyncWear unlocks real features that were previously impossible when pairing iPhones with Wear OS devices.  

✨ **What you can do with SyncWear:**  
- 🔔 **Notification Sync** – View and manage iOS notifications in real time  
- 📞 **Call Sync** – Get incoming call alerts, accept/reject from your watch  
- 🖼 **Image Sync** – Transfer photos via a built-in local server  
- 👥 **Contact Sync** – Import and access iPhone contacts directly on the watch
